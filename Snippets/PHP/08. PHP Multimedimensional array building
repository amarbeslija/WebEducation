# This one is about how to build an multimedinsional array for needs like multi-level menu
# The first concern is that you rember which item belongs to which parent in database (item_parent_id here)
# The second thing is that you need to get an one-dimensional associative array from the database, which you will sort with code below

# So, when we have an array, we can do something like this:

function buildLevels(array $array, $parent_id = 0) {
  # Create helper array
  $level = array();
  
  # Go through the array
  foreach ($array as $element) {
     if ($element['item_parent_id'] == $parent_id) {
         $children = buildLevels($array, $element['id']);
         if ($children) {
             $element['children'] = $children;
         }
         $level[] = $element;
     }
  }

  return $level;
 }

$multidimensionalArray = buildLevels($myArray);

?>
